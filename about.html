            <h2>What is our Nature?</h2>
            <p>We are a new Eco-Friendly Company that aspire to create awareness regarding how unconscious shopping can contribute to the destruction 
                of many Ecosystems and bring alternatives/products to those who wish to reduce their negative impact on the environment,at an affordable price point. </p>
            <p>Climate Change, Global Warming and Pollution have become increasingly concerning in our reality and toxic waste is harming people, animals, plants, and habitats.
                We need to act <span class="important"> NOW </span> before it is too late!
            </p>
            <p>Our Planet canâ€™t be viewed simply as land-there are many Ecosystems that depend on us and everyone must do everything they can to preserve and take care of what was here before us and will continue
                long after we are gone. </p>
