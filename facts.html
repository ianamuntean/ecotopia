				<h1>Did you know...</h1>
				<h2>Climate change has become a major concern for many people around the world, particularly young people who believe their future is jeopardised because of its effects. 
					Knowing the facts about climate change can help you participate in discussions about what's going on with our planet and what we can do to stop global warming.</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)  in our atmosphere, 
							as of May 2020, is the highest it has been in human history. </li>
						<li>NASA data show that average global temperatures in 2019 were 1.8 degrees 
							F (0.98 degrees C) warmer than the 20th century average. In fact, the five warmest
							years in the 1880–2019 record have all occurred since 2015.</li>
						<li>Eleven percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are due 
							to deforestation, comparable to the emissions from all the passenger vehicles on the
							planet.</li>
						<li>Tropical forests are incredibly effective at storing carbon, providing at least
							a third of the mitigation action needed to prevent the worst climate change scenarios. 
							Yet nature-based solutions receive only 3% of all climate funding.</li>
						<li>More than 1 million species are at risk of extinction by climate change.</li>
						<li>In the last 30 years, half of the world’s coral reefs have died. Global warming
							puts coral reefs in danger as the ocean warms, scientist fear that coral reefs will not
							be able to adapt quickly enough to the resulting changing conditions, and bleaching 
							incidents and diseases will increase.</li>
						<li>Since 1870, global sea levels have risen by about 8 inches.</li>
